# SIGANN Guido

SIGANN Guido is a repository of annotation guidelines for text maintained by the ACL Special Interest Group for Annotation (SIGANN).

*Under construction*

## License

MIT

SIGANN Guido is based on the [Reverie template](http://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of annotation guideline entries. Please follow the steps below to add your guidelines (or anyone else's, if you think they should be part of the repository) to Guido.

### Step 1: Determine a name for your entry.
The name for your entry should be ``yyyy-mm-dd-your-title`` where the date corresponds to the day you are adding the entry, and the title can be any informative name.
You can look [here](https://github.com/SIGANN/guido/tree/main/_posts) for some examples.

### Step 2: Create a branch.
Type the name determined in Step 1 into the branches field (see screenshot below) and click "create branch".

Now, it should look like this:

<img src="http://sigann.github.io/guido/images/guido2.png" alt="Screenshot" width="600"/>

### Step 3: Create your entry.
Go to the folder called ``_posts`` and create a new file called ``yyyy-mm-dd-your-title.md``.

The file will be automatically opened in edit mode.
Copy the contents of the [template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIGANN/guido/main/templates/template.md) into the file that you have just created.
Now, please fill out the template using the [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) syntax. Please follow the instructions in the template.
If you would like to add an image, please upload it into the ``images`` folder.
You can add them by clicking on this button. After selecting your image(s), please click on ``Commit changes`` at the bottom of the page.


We also offer to host annotation guidelines files but only if they are not hosted elsewhere.
If you would like to attach PDF files, you can put them into the ``attachments'' folder. You can then link them as follows (instead of using the URL as indicated in the template):
``[Link to Annotation Guidelines](http://sigann.github.io/guido/images/your-attachment-filename.pdf)''

Scroll to bottom and click ``Commit changes''.

### Step 4: Almost done, tell us about it!
Go to the ``branches`` view (see image how to get there).

Then, at your branch, click ``New pull request``.

Enter a message and submit.

That's it.

If your entry doesn't appear within a week, feel free to remind us via e-mail to approve your request.

Maybe someone noticed that I have a typo in my branch name - of course you'll be more accurate. :)
