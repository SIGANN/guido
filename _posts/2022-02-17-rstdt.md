# Description
*Taken from the guidelines (see link above):*

This reference manual presents the guidelines used to develop a large discourse-annotated corpus
for community-wide use. The resulting resource consists of 385 documents of American English
selected from the Penn Treebank (Marcus, et al, 1993), annotated in the framework of Rhetorical
Structure Theory. We assume here that the reader is familiar with the basic principle of RST, as
presented in Mann and Thompson (1988). We also refer the reader to Carlson et al. (2001), which
describes a number of issues and challenges in building this corpus, and to Marcu et al. (1999),
which addresses experimental issues in annotating the discourse structure of entire texts in the
RST framework.
